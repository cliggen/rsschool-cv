##### I wanna be Front-End developer. My wish is to create projects & web apps that can be helpful. I chose that direction because it's a way I can realize my potential. I like to fixing things and inventing something. Of course, I've lack of expirience of web development because I'm just started. At past life I'm doctor, but our system killed all motivation to grow and develop as professional. Since IT-environment let me get some air to breath in case of professional grow and some self-enjoying of doing that. It's a perfect _"competition"_ for me.
#### Qualities that help me:
* ##### Attention
* ##### Perseverance
* ##### Curiosity
* ##### Thirst for experimentation
